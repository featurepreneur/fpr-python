get a string - check for caps in the string 
check whether ip is public or private / rule 

Once upon a time , there was a manager . He assigned a task to one of the new junior developers to add their IP address 
to the EC2 instance. As the developer was new , he provided an IP address to the manager which happen to be a private IP address. 
When the manager tried to add the given address to the instance, he was not able to do it. He found out the mistake and went back
to the junior developer and explained about public and private IP addresses. He made it clear that when someone asks for IP one
should  always give the public one and not the private IP address. SInce the developer did not know how to check the address, 
a python code was given to him.
